# Trilium-Nord

A dark nord theme for trilium, with many tweaks to make it look all-around better, and also includes a dirty hack to add scrolling past the last line. Probably not finished but should be usable.

Usage instructions in file.

Screenshot below is outdated the theme looks a bit different.
